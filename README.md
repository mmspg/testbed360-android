# Testbed 360
A Testbed for Subjective Evaluation of Omnidirectional Visual Content - Android version.

This software was developed during a semester project in MMSPG, EPFL by [LM. Garret](https://github.com/lmgarret).

The main purpose of this testbed is 
to provide researchers with a tool to perform
subjective assessment of omnidirectional images.
The testbed consists of a software application for the handheld
and mobile platforms and can be used with head-mounted
displays. The application is able to visualize omnidirectional
images and video represented in different projections. The
set of supported projections or geometrical representations
can be easily extended.
